From a young age, I was fascinated by the inner workings of technology. I started my career at 9 years old, driven by an insatiable curiosity nurtured in my father's phone repair shop in Ukraine, where I used to hang out since I was an infant. There, I tinkered with every chipset and circuit board I could find, igniting a lifelong passion for engineering.

With over a decade of experience as a software and hardware engineer, I have tackled a wide array of projects, from developing websites for local businesses to pioneering advanced [facial recognition systems](https://github.com/revive-tools), [innovative IoT applications](https://index.0x77.dev/paper/15587-1729-4061.2025.326222), autonomous driving solutions, [internet censorship circumvention](https://index.0x77.dev/patent/us11968254b1), and [innovative solutions for higher education](https://index.0x77.dev/patent/wo2024107645a1).  
  
My expertise spans a broad spectrum, including cloud solutions, web development, UI/UX, DevOps, mobile applications, computer-generated imagery (CGI), computer-generated audio (CGA), media codecs, desktop software, cybersecurity, embedded systems, advanced AI/ML, Big Data, high-performance computing (HPC), industrial automation, and computer networking.

The war in Ukraine brought me to Sweden, where I discovered new avenues for expressing my thoughts, feelings, and perceptions of the world around me. This awakening of my artistic side led me on a journey across Europe, collaborating with diverse artists on both private and public events. From galleries to raves and classical performances, I had the opportunity to showcase my unique fusion of technology and creative expression. Coding at raves with my laptop or engaging in live-coding performances allows me to seamlessly merge my passions for art and technology.

During my early middle school days in Kyiv, I would sneak into university lectures while the students nursed their hangovers. Immersed in a world of experienced minds, I absorbed every word, fueling my passion for innovation and creativity. These formative experiences, coupled with the vibrant Ukrainian modern art scene and the electrifying rave culture, have left an indelible mark on my artistic sensibilities, guiding and inspiring my work to this day as I navigate the realm of art and technology, fusing cutting-edge innovation with avant-garde expression.

Driven by a mission to create groundbreaking solutions and experiences that push the boundaries of what's possible, I am constantly exploring new frontiers. Whether I am conducting computational neuroscience research, developing cutting-edge networking technologies, or delving into the realms of AI and cybersecurity, I am always striving to innovate at the intersection of technology and creative expression. My philosophy is rooted in the belief that by merging seemingly disparate fields, we can unlock new possibilities and create a better future for all.
